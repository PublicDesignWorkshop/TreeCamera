# Tree Camera Software

This repo contains all the software you'll need to set up your own super long timelapse tree camera. `bin` has files that run on the actual raspberry pi, and `sleepy-pi` has the software that gets uploaded to the Arduino. You'll want to install [ino](//github.com/amperka/ino/) on the raspberry pi for compiling/uploading to the arduino from the raspberry pi, as well as following the instructions at [Spell Foundry](//www.spellfoundry.com) for setting up the Sleepy Pi 2.
